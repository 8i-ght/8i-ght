<h1 align="left">About Me</h3>
<p>
Hi, my name is Kayden Roberts I am a Senior Student at Cape Central High School in Cape Girardeau Missouri. My goal is to become a Software Engineer one day after I finish college. Currently I am working towards that goal by taking a computer coding and programming class at the Cape Girardeau Career Technology Center. I am wanting to go into the field of Computer Science because I believe there is a lot of promise in this career path in the future and I also enjoy the complexity of software.
    
Currently as a student at Cape Central High School, I have a 3.45 GPA and am hoping to get it up to a 3.5. I have took a number of computer classes at my high school to further my knowledge of software. After I graduate High School I am planning on going to a 4 year University to major in Computer Science, and gain certifications to become a better coder/programmer. One of my ultimate goals to help advance the field of machine learning and learn the extent of how powerful AI could become in the future. 

Outside of school I am currently employed at Walmart and work anywhere from 20-25 hours a week. Something else that I am going to be involved in later in the school year is I am going to be running track in the spring. I really enjoy going to the gym and running the track even though I haven't ran for the school besides for what I'm going to be doing this year. Working has helped me develop better social skills and allowed me to be accustomed to a fast paced environment.
